Durin is an opinionated approach to ENS L2 subnames. Durin consists of:

1. Registry factory on [supported chains](#active-registry-factory-deployments)
2. Registrar template
3. Gateway server
4. L1 resolver

## Instructions To Deploy L2 ENS Subnames

This repo is meant to be used in conjuction with [Durin.dev](https://durin.dev/), which provides a frontend for deploying the registry & enabling name resolution.

### 1. Deploy a Registry

Go to [Durin.dev](https://durin.dev/). Choose Sepolia or Mainnet ENS name resolution. Pick a supported L2. Deploy.

Once complete, note the deployed L2 registry address.

### 2. Enable Name Resolution

To connect your newly deployed L2 registry with your ENS name on L1, change the name's resolver to `0x8A968aB9eb8C084FBC44c531058Fc9ef945c3D61` and call `setL2Registry()` with the L2 registry's address and chain ID.

Both of these steps can be done via [durin.dev](https://durin.dev) or the [ENS manager app](http://app.ens.domains).

### 3. Customize the Registrar Template

> [!NOTE]  
> Durin uses [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). To install it, follow the [instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

Durin provides a registrar template that is meant to be customized. Common customizations include adding pricing, implementing allow lists, and enabling token gating.

You can either clone this repo and modify [L2Registrar.sol](./src/examples/L2Registrar.sol) directly, or write a new contract in your existing project. If you prefer the latter, simply import [IL2Registry.sol](./src/interfaces/IL2Registry.sol) to your project so you can interact with the registry you deployed earlier and skip to step 5.

To get started, clone this repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:resolverworks/durin.git
cd durin
```

Once cloned, modify [L2Registrar.sol](./src/examples/L2Registrar.sol) as needed.

### 4. Deploy L2Registrar Contract

To deploy the L2Registrar contract, you will need to prepare a `.env` file and run the deploy script.

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the new `.env` file and set the variables that are marked as required at the top, then run the following command:

```shell
bash ./bash/DeployL2Registrar.sh
```

### 5. Connect Registrar to L2Registry

Only approved Registrars can call `createSubnode()` on the Registry. The owner of the registry can add as many Registrars as they want.

To add a Registrar, visit your Registry on Etherscan and call `addRegistrar()` with the newly deployed Registrar's address.

Finally, you'll be able to mint subnames via the Registrar.

## Contracts

This repo includes all of the smart contract (L1 and L2) required to enable subname issuance.

- [L1Resolver](./src/L1Resolver.sol): L1 contract that forwards ENS queries to the L2.
- [L2RegistryFactory](./src/L2RegistryFactory.sol): L2 contract for creating new registries.
- [L2Registry](./src/L2Registry.sol): L2 contract that stores subnames as ERC721 NFTs. This contract is also responsible for storing data like address and text records.
- [L2Registrar](./src/examples/L2Registrar.sol): An example registrar contract that can mint subnames. This is meant to be customized.

## Architecture

![architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06065784-0516-498e-a512-d7b63892599a)

> [!NOTE]  
> A dependency for supporting `-withSignature` methods on new chains is a deployment of UniversalSigValidator to `0x164af34fAF9879394370C7f09064127C043A35E9`. The deployment is permissionless and can be found [here](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/8c414e4c41dce49c49efd0bf82c10a145cdc8f0a/deploy/utils/00_deploy_universal_sig_validator.ts).

## Deploying Durin

> [!NOTE]  
> Developers that want to issue subnames on one of the chains listed above in the [Active Registry Factory Deployments](#active-registry-factory-deployments) section do not need to read any further.

1. Create a `.env` file via `cp .env.example .env`. You don't need to change anything.
2. Add/uncomment the chains you want to deploy to in [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml#L23) and [DeployL2Contracts.s.sol](./scripts/DeployL2Contracts.s.sol#L30).
3. Run `./bash/DeployL2Contracts.sh` to deploy the registry implementation and factory contracts to the specified chains.
4. Run `./bash/VerifyL2Contracts.sh` for each chain you deployed to, changing `NETWORK` and `BLOCK_EXPLORER_API_KEY` in the files, to verify all the contracts you just deployed.
5. Add your chain(s) to [query.ts](./gateway/src/ccip-read/query.ts#L8) in the gateway config.

## Initial Setup

Run `./bash/DeployL1Resolver.sh` followed by `./bash/VerifyL1Resolver.sh` to deploy and verify the L1 Resolver. This is L2 chain agnostic, so only needs to be done once.

## CREATE2 Tips

For generating a CREATE2 salt to deploy the L2RegistryFactory, run the command below. Use [./scripts/L2RegistryFactoryInitCode.s.sol](./scripts/L2RegistryFactoryInitCode.s.sol) to calculate the init code hash.

```bash
export FACTORY="0x13b0D85CcB8bf860b6b79AF3029fCA081AE9beF2"
export INIT_CODE_HASH="<HASH_OF_YOUR_CONTRACT_INIT_CODE_GOES_HERE>"
cast create2 --starts-with dddddd --deployer $FACTORY --init-code-hash $INIT_CODE_HASH
```

Once you have a salt that you're happy with, update `L2_REGISTRY_FACTORY_SALT` in `.env` so it's used in the deployment script.
